## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### What I learned
This project really thought me alot, especially in the aspect of using storing user preference with localStorage.
```react
 const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      if (!response.ok) {
        setIsError(true);
        setIsLoading(false);
        return;
      }
```
```css

main {
  max-width: 900px;
  width: 90%;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: var(--Blue-900);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(61, 8, 8, 0.1),
    0 4px 6px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  display: flex;
  padding: 1rem;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  font-size: var(--FS);
  position: relative;
}
```
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

I hope to build more with React and also improve my responsive design.
